Exercise 3
==

* Ask the user for a set of numbers, then calculate the average of the numbers.
  * Define two variables: `numberCount` (how many numbers the user enters) and `numberSum` (the sum of all the numbers).
  * Use `while (true) {` to loop.
  * Inside the loop, use `prompt` to get numbers from the user.
  * The first time the user enters a NaN value (`isNaN`), then `break` out of the loop.
  * Calculate the average and show it in an `alert`.
