Exercise 1
==

* Ask the user how old they are, then calculate their age in seconds as of their last birthday (don't worry about leap years).
  * First, use variables to find out how many seconds are in a day, in a year, then multiply by how old the user is.
  * Get the user's input in a `prompt`, and output the number of seconds in an `alert`.
