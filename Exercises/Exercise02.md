Exercise 2
==


* Write a loop that makes seven calls to console.log to output the following triangle:

        #
        ##
        ###
        ####
        #####
        ######
        #######

  * Hints:
    * Use a for loop: `for (var i = 0; i < 7; i++)`
    * You can go from "#" to "##" by adding a character: `myString += "#";`
